# DBF to CSV Converter

This Python script reads a `.dbf` file, checks if a corresponding `.csv` file is up-to-date, and writes the data to a `.csv` file if necessary. It is designed to be generic and reusable, making it easy to use for various DBF file conversion tasks.

## Features

- Reads data from `.dbf` files using the `dbfread` library.
- Checks if a corresponding `.csv` file exists and is up-to-date.
- If the `.csv` file is outdated or missing, updates/creates the `.csv` file with the latest data from the `.dbf` file.
- Uses the `pandas` library to handle data efficiently.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas` library
- `dbfread` library

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas dbfread
